# Cryptography Ciphers

This repository contains Python implementations of various cryptography ciphers. These ciphers can be used to encrypt and decrypt text and files.

## Ciphers Included

1. Affine Cipher
2. Atbash Cipher
3. Baconian Cipher
4. Base64
5. Bifid Cipher

## Usage

To use the ciphers provided in this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook `Cryptography_Ciphers.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment, such as Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each code cell sequentially.
4. Follow the instructions provided to select a cipher, enter the text or select a file, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.

## File Encryption/Decryption

Each cipher supports file encryption and decryption. When selecting a cipher, you have the option to encrypt or decrypt a text or file. If you choose to encrypt or decrypt a file, you'll be prompted to upload the file from your local machine.
